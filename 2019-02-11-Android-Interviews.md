## Android Interviews: Asking the stuff that matters


- Don't look for a good dev, look for a good fit. 
- Something that's missing in your company.
- Will they find the work exciting or will they get bored.
- What if you want a standard intermediate Android Developer?
- Will this person get along in the environment of your company? Will they enjoy it?
- Nobody is going to have all the required skills for a project. 
- Assume that they have some skills coming in that you need and they'll acquire more skills along the way.

- Put a job description that shows what they will achieve instead of what they'll be doing.
- Don't put "x" years of Android experience, instead just Android app dev experience is fine.
  - Reason: Years doesn't tell you anything useful, filters out honest people who are good.
- Be specific but numbers don't mean anything!


### Resumes

- Don't read too much into resumes, some people suck at resumes

### The actual interview

- Gotta find a shortcut to determine if someone is an experienced dev.
- Ask some Android-specific questions?
  - When you ask trivia questions, you're creating an antagonistic environment.
  - Easy to google and find answers so you might get deceptive candidate.
- Your Android questions only cover what you know about it
  - What happens when the candidate knows all of the stuff you don't?
  - You risk creating a team that only has clones of you


Golden rule of dev interviews:
- Only ask questions that have many correct answers!
- Examples:
  - What is a service (too specific, not open)
    - Instead: How would you manage background tasks? (You get different perspectives)
  - Have you used Room?
    - Instead: How would you store app data?

- What is your experience with ... (ex: implementing network security)


Goal: Ask questions they can't Google, because they could've Googled it at the job.

The narrow the scope of your question, the narrow your window is into what they know.

### The whiteboard

- Something about Nonograms and Knights and Knaves.
- How good you are at it, is relative to how many times you've done it before.
- Make sure the questions you ask are relevant to the work they'll be doing.
- Examples:
  - Snapchat:
    - How would you cache images on-device while keeping them private?
  - Netflix:
    - How would you ensure offline videos can't be pirated?
  - Take a problem you, the interviewer, are solving at work, and try to solve it with the interviewee.
- Have multiple possible answers
- Whiteboarding is anxiety-inducing. Very shy people might even freeze. You want to bring out their best, make them feel as confident as possible. It's very challenging to be judged on continuously while doing it.
- Maybe find a problem that even you haven't solved it and try to solve it with them together.

Deep dive. Ask open ended questions about a challenge they faced. Keep digging in, be curious. Also, be humble. You are the student, they're the teacher.

Benefits: 
- If people are passionate about something, they'll be confident talking about it.
- Cooperation, not competition as you both want to bring out the best in the person.

### The decision, defining your culture

"We've decided not to go ahead with your application."

Terrible sentence, no one wants to be rejected. Also, where's the reason!?

- Raise the esteem of your company.
- Example:
  - Person told him what was missing (skill-wise).
- We tend to hide behind the corporate machine
- People are human beings
- Explain why
- Give them set of things they could improve
- They won't know how to improve next time around
- What if you act like they're an actual employee? 
  - Give them constructive feedback like you would at work

Fairness

- How do you know you've been fair?
- Clarify for the person
- Clarify for yourself so you know the reasons.


Send emails to the person, for both rejecting or accepting. Tell them your decision, some positives, some suggestions and wish them luck in their search. Tell them quickly.
